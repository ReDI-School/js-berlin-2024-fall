Today's lesson will be the last lesson before starting with the project, and we will be doing a small project to get you
up and running!

The structure is very loose, it is up to you to explore and find what you enjoy!

## Dogs

> Display a random dog image

https://kinduff.github.io/dog-api/

together with images.

## Holidays

Can you add a pin showing your current position?

## SimpleParallax

## Mastodon

### Task

Can you show the published posts and author?

Note that there are many different Mastodon instances to choose from, and they might have different API restrictions.
One of the larger ones is "https://mastodon.social", and its API can be accessed without any API keys or registration.

---

## Sources

A lot of APIs can be found here for example: https://publicapis.io/

Additionally, some websites lists royalty free images, for example https://pixabay.com/

---

### More stuff to do!

You don't have to do all of this, these are just ideas!

Iterate on what you have and add more functionality and/or content.

* Allow the users to open the original source (with a link)
* Add `next` and `previous` pages buttons
* Show loading while the data is being fetched.
* Show the content creation or publishing date.
* Allow the user to search for a keyword
* Or show article earlier or later than a certain date

---

### More advanced?

* Allow the user to read the original content, by embedding it in an iframe
* Automatically load more content when the user scrolls to the end
