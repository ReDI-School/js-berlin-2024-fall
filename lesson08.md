# Basic Frontend - Fall 2024

Lesson 8, Thursday, 2024-10-10

---

### Quiz

What will this output?

```js
let first = true;
let second = false;

console.log(first && second);
console.log(!first);
```

Answer: false, false

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Refresher: Data Types

```js
// string
let name = "Alan";

// number
let age = 24;

// boolean
let isProgrammer = true;

// undefined
let doNotKnow;

// null
let empty = null;

```

---

### Refresher: Functions

```js
function sayHi() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

---

### Problem with simple values

Let's imagine you need to describe three friends:

```js
let friend1Name = "Alan";
let friend1Age = 30;
let friend2Name = "Ada";
let friend2Age = 35;
let friend3Name = "Grace";
let friend3Age = 42;
```

We need _a lot_ of variables.

---

### Problem with function parameters

Now imagine a function that operates on 2 people:

```js
function introduce(person1Name, person1Age, person2Name, person2Age) {
  console.log("Hello, I am " + person1Name + ", I am " + person1Age + " years old.");
  console.log("Hello" + person1Name + ", my name is " + person2Name + ", I am " + person2Age + " years old.");
}
```

The parameter list gets rather long, and if you'd like to introduce another variable, it gets messy.

---

Wouldn't it be nicer if we could group information that belongs together somehow?

### Objects

An **object**, in Javascript, is a group of *key* / *value* pairs

We can think of key/value pairs as words in a dictionary

* a word is the **key**
* the definition is the **value**

![Dictionary](images/dictionary.jpg) <!-- .element width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" -->

---

### Objects

Basic example of an object

```js
let person = {
  firstName: 'Alan',
  age: 32,
  isProgrammer: true
};
```

---

### Objects

key/value pairs are also referred to as **properties**

```js
let person = {
  firstName: 'Alan', // comma
  age: 32,           // comma
  isProgrammer: true // comma is optional
};
```
* can you name all the properties in this **person** object?
* and its keys?
* and its values?

---

### Objects: examples

```js
let book = {
  title: 'The Lord of the Rings',
  author: 'J. R. R. Tolkien',
  publicationYear: 1954,
  pages: 1216
};
```

```js
let car = {
  make: 'Volkswagen',
  model: 'Golf',
  modelYear: 2005,
};
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Task: Introduction

Define a variable called `myInfo` and initialize it with an object containing the following information about you:

* name
* favorite food
* hair color
* eye color

---

### Objects: accessing properties

Now we know how to create objects, what can we do with it?

```js
let friend = {
    name: "Ada",
    age: 30
};

// we can access the value of a property using the "." operator
let friendName = friend.name; // friendName points to "Ada"
console.log(friendName + " is my friend.");

// we can also change the value
friend.age = 31;
console.log("She is " + friend.age + " years old.")
```

---

### Objects: accessing properties

```js
let book = {
  title: 'The Lord of the Rings',
  author: 'J. R. R. Tolkien',
  publicationYear: 1954,
  pages: 1216
};

console.log(book.title + " was written by " + book.author);
```

---

### Objects: accessing properties

```js
let car = {
  make: 'Volkswagen',
  model: 'Golf',
  modelYear: 2005,
};

if (car.modelYear > 2000) {
  console.log('The car is relatively modern.')
} else {
  console.log('The car is rather old.')
}

```

---

### Quiz: accessing properties

```js
let car = {
    make: 'Volkswagen',
    model: 'Golf',
    modelYear: 2005,
};
console.log('The car has ' + car.wheels + ' wheels');
```

* What's the output in the console?

```js
The car has undefined wheels
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

### Object Properties

So objects consist of key-value pairs (also called properties).

Keys point to values.

```js
let me = {
  firstName: 'Grace',
  age: 30,
  isProgrammer: true
};
```

So far, we've used strings, numbers, and booleans as possible values. What else could we use?

---

```js
let me = {
    firstName: "Grace",
    address: {
        street: "Invalidenstraße",
        city: "Berlin"
    }
};
```

How many properties does the object above have? How can you access the `city` in the `me` variable above?

```js
let myCity = me.address.city;
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

```js
let me = {
    name: "Grace",
    greeting: function(dayOfWeek) {
        if (dayOfWeek === "Monday") {
            return "Get out of my face";
        } else {
            return "Hi, how are you?";
        }
    }
};
```

How would you call the greeting function?

```js
let message = me.greeting();
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Methods

A function inside an object is also called **method**:

```js
// I am a function!
function sayHi() {
  return "Hi!";
}

let me = {
    // I'm a method!
    sayHi: function() {
      return "Hi!";
    }
};
```

---

### What is console.log?

You've been using objects and methods this whole time!

`console` is a "global" object, and `log` is a method belonging to `console`.


---

### Task 1

Start with the `myInfo` object you created in the earlier task that contains your name and favorite food.

Write a function that takes that object as a parameter and introduces that person using `console.log`.

Example output:

```js
introducePerson(myInfo);
// "Hi, my name is Alan and my favorite food is Pizza"
```

---

### Task 2

Now create another object called `friendInfo` with the same properties as `myInfo`.

Introduce your friend using the same function you created in part 1.

Example output:

```js
introducePerson(friendInfo);
// "Hi, my name is Ada and my favorite food is Pasta"
```

---

### Task 3

Create a function that takes two "person" objects. Compare their ages, then use `console.log` to print who is older of the two.

You may need to first add an "age" property to your objects if you don't have it already.

Example output:

```js
whoIsOlder(myInfo, friendInfo);
// "Ada is older"
```

---

### Task 4

Create a method to introduce yourself (using console.log). Create a object within that represents your address.

```js
myInfo.introduce();
// "Hi, my name is Grace"
console.log(myInfo.address.city); // "Berlin"
console.log(myInfo.address.country); // "Germany"
```

---

### Bonus Practice

Change the `me` objects in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReDI-School/js-berlin-2024-fall/main/objects/index.html

Only change `me` object, nothing else in that file!
